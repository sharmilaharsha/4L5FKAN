# 4L5FKAN-resilient-to-GAN
Work submitted to Applied Soft Computing

## Overview
4L5FKAN is a research project focused on developing robust methods to defend against adversarial attacks generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The primary goal is to enhance the resilience of machine learning models in adversarial environments, ensuring reliable performance even when faced with sophisticated synthetic data manipulations.

## Features
Novel defense mechanisms against GAN-generated adversarial attacks

Experimental framework for evaluating model robustness

Reproducible experiments and results

Designed for extensibility to other adversarial scenarios

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sharmilaharsha/4L5FKAN.git

cd 4L5FKAN

## Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

## Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

## Step-1: PDF features 
PDF Parsers: it has two scripts to extract the features of a PDF

OurDataset Sample: It has the csv file showing the features extracted by the parsers

Run Parser-1.py


Run Parser-2.py


Run Merge.py 


output: dataset.csv


## Step 2: 4L5FKAN Training
Run TrainingKAN.py

Run TestingKAN.py

Tabulate the metrics -Actual Performance

This shows actual performance of KAN

## Step 3: Adversarial Samples generation

MArchive is our collection of all the PDFs 

Feature extraction done by our parsers to - dataset.csv

dataset.csv is used to generate adversarial samples using WGAN-GP with more than 75% similarity.

Run Git-WGAN-GP-good-DQS-model.py 

Output adv_samples.csv 

adv_samples.csv contain features for adversarial samples

Run Merge.py to merge  both dataset.csv and adv_samples.csv 

Whole.csv is merged data containing both original and generated samples

## Step 4: Adversarial Testing

Run TestingKAN.py using  adv_samples.csv 

Tabulate the metrics - deviation in actual Performance can be noticed

Decreased Performance showing adversarial resistance

## Step 5: For adversarial Training

Run Git-KfoldKANwithExplanations.py for the dataset Whole.csv

Tabulate the metrics-Improved performance can be noticed with adversarial training

Explanations can be derived for the sample identification
